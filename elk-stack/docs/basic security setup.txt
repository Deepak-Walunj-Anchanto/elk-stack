1. Why Security Is Needed in ELK
By default, older Elasticsearch versions allowed:
Anonymous access
Anyone to read/write indices
Anyone to delete data

Enabling security ensures:
Every request is authenticated
Each component has least-privilege access
Credentials are not hardcoded
Logs and metrics are protected

🧩 2. Architecture Overview (Corrected)
| Component          | User Used         | Purpose                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Human login        | `elastic`         | Full admin access                    |
| Kibana → ES        | `kibana_system`   | Kibana background tasks              |
| Logstash (metrics) | `logstash_system` | Logstash monitoring & license checks |
| Logstash (data)    | `logstash_writer` | Indexing application logs into ES    |

📌 Important distinction
logstash_system → monitoring only
logstash_writer → actual log ingestion

👤 3. Built-In and Custom Users

3.1 elastic (Superuser)
Purpose
Administrative user
Full access to cluster, indices, and security APIs

Used for
Logging into Kibana UI
Creating roles and users
Managing index templates and ILM
Debugging and cluster administration

Why we don’t use it for services
Too powerful
Violates least-privilege principle
High blast radius if compromised

3.2 kibana_system

Purpose
Internal service account for Kibana

Used for
Creating .kibana* indices
Saving dashboards and visualizations
Running background jobs (telemetry, saved objects)

Important
❌ Cannot log into Kibana UI
✔ Used only by the Kibana backend

Why it exists
Prevents Kibana from using superuser credentials
Limits impact if Kibana credentials are compromised

3.3 logstash_system (Built-in, Monitoring Only)

Purpose
Internal service account for Logstash

Used for
Sending Logstash monitoring data to Elasticsearch
License validation
Health checks

❌ What it does NOT do
❌ Cannot write application logs
❌ Cannot create or write indices

Why it exists
Allows Logstash to report health without admin rights
Prevents abuse of indexing permissions

How it is created
Automatically created by Elasticsearch

Password is manually set using:
elasticsearch-reset-password -u logstash_system

3.4 logstash_writer (Custom User – Critical)

Purpose
Dedicated log ingestion user for Logstash

Used for
Writing logs into:
logs-*-pt (data streams: logs-django-pt, logs-celery-pt, logs-celerybeat-pt, logs-flower-pt, logs-nginx-pt, logs-react-pt)

Why this user is required
Built-in logstash_system cannot index data
Elasticsearch enforces least-privilege
Prevents Logstash from having admin rights

Security Benefits
Index-scoped permissions only
No access to security APIs
No access to unrelated indices

🐳 4. Docker Compose Configuration – Explained

4.1 Elasticsearch Service
environment:
  - discovery.type=single-node
  - xpack.security.enabled=true
volumes:
  - es_data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data

| Setting                       | Reason                             |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `discovery.type=single-node`  | Prevents cluster bootstrap issues  |
| `xpack.security.enabled=true` | Enables authentication             |
| `es_data`                     | Persists users, passwords, indices |

4.2 Kibana Service

environment:
  ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS: http://elasticsearch:9200
  ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME: kibana_system
volumes:
  - kibana_config:/usr/share/kibana/config

| Item            | Why                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| `kibana_system` | Service authentication   |
| Keystore        | Secure password storage  |
| Volume          | Prevents credential loss |

4.3 Logstash Service

environment:
  # Monitoring
  xpack.monitoring.enabled: "true"
  xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.username: logstash_system
  xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password: "******"

  # Ingestion
  LOGSTASH_WRITER_PASSWORD: "******"

Why two users are used
| User              | Purpose              |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| `logstash_system` | Monitoring & license |
| `logstash_writer` | Log ingestion        |

📦 5. Docker Volumes – What They Store & Why

5.1 es_data Volume 
es_data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data 
Stores: Indices Users & roles Password hashes Cluster metadata 
Why critical: Without it, passwords reset on restart Data loss on docker compose down 

5.2 kibana_config Volume 
kibana_config:/usr/share/kibana/config 
stores: kibana.keystore 
Secure settings (ES password) Why critical Prevents re-adding passwords after restart Ensures Kibana reconnects automatically 

5.3 logstash_config Volume 
logstash_config:/usr/share/logstash/config 
Stores 
Internal Logstash state Monitoring metadata 
Why useful 
Clean restarts Future TLS configs

🔐 6. Logstash Pipeline Security (logstash.conf)

elasticsearch {
  hosts                  => ["elasticsearch:9200"]
  user                   => "logstash_writer_pt"
  password               => "${LOGSTASH_WRITER_PASSWORD}"
  manage_template        => false
  ecs_compatibility      => "v8"
  data_stream            => true  # Uses data streams (logs-*-pt) instead of indices
}

| Without Auth     | With Auth        |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 401 / 403 errors | Secure indexing  |
| Silent drops     | Auditable writes |
| Insecure         | Least privilege  |

📌 logstash_system is never used in pipeline outputs.

🔁 7. Password Creation & Setup Flow

* Start Elasticsearch only 
* Reset passwords using: elasticsearch-reset-password 
* Store Kibana password in keystore 
* Inject Logstash password via env vars 
* Restart services
elastic

Result
* Passwords persist 
* Containers can be recreated safely 
* No secrets in Git

8. code: 
* docker compose up -d elasticsearch 
* docker exec -it elasticsearch bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -i -u elastic
* docker exec -it elasticsearch bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -i -u kibana_system 
* docker exec -it elasticsearch bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -i -u logstash_system 
* docker compose up -d kibana 
* docker exec -it kibana bin/kibana-keystore create 
* docker exec -it kibana bin/kibana-keystore add elasticsearch.password 
* docker compose down kibana 
* docker compose up -d kibana
* in localhost:5601:
	Kibana → Dev Tools → Console
	PUT _security/role/logstash_writer_pt
	{   
      "cluster": ["monitor"],
  		"indices": [
    		{
      				"names": [
        				"logs-*-pt"
   				   ],
      		"privileges": [
        		"create",
        		"create_index",
            "create_doc",
            "read",
        		"write",
        		"index"
      		]
    		}
  		]
	}

| Privilege      | Reason                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `create_index` | Allow first-time index creation    |
| `write`        | Allow bulk writes                  |
| `index`        | Allow document indexing            |
| `monitor`      | Required by Logstash output plugin |

*Create User: logstash_writer
POST _security/user/logstash_writer_pt
{
  "password": "Password",
  "roles": ["logstash_writer_pt"],
  "full_name": "Logstash writer for PT data streams"
}

Result
User can only write logs
No admin or security access
Safe for production ingestion

* add logstash conf
* docker compose up -d logstash
* (In git bash or pwsh) curl -u elastic:Password -X POST http://localhost:9200/_security/api_key -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"docker-openapi-key"}'
  To fetch API key to use in OpenAPI
* Create elasticsearch index template:
  curl -u elastic:Password -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/_index_template/pt-logs" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @elasticsearch-index-template-pt-logs.json

🔗 9. How Authentication Works (End-to-End)

9.1 Kibana → Elasticsearch
Uses kibana_system
Access limited to .kibana*

9.2 Logstash → Elasticsearch
Monitoring: logstash_system
Indexing: logstash_writer

9.3 User → Kibana
Logs in as elastic
Full admin access

✅ 10. Why This Design Is Correct

✔ Secure
✔ Least-privilege
✔ Docker-safe
✔ Restart-proof
✔ Clear separation of concerns
✔ Production-aligned

🧱 11. What Can Be Added Later

TLS / HTTPS
Per-pipeline users
ILM policies
Multi-node cluster security

🏁 12. Final Summary

This configuration ensures:
Elasticsearch is protected
Kibana authenticates safely
Logstash monitors and ingests securely
Credentials persist across restarts
Security is auditable and scalable
